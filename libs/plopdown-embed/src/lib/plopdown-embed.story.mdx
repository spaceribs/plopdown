# Plopdown Format

Welcome to the documentation for creating your own plopdown files! We don't have
an editor yet for the format, but it adheres to the [WebVTT spec](https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/) and
JSON.

## Headers

The top of the file contains general information about the plopdown, attribution, and hints about
what video it should be associated with. Heres an example with a description of each field:

```yaml
WEBVTT                                              # The file always starts with WEBVTT
_id: 85363ae6-18d6-4cbc-a748-7910ecefe8c6           # The ID is some unique identifier to prevent duplicates
_rev: 2edad9fb-6b8f-468b-98cd-4261d37686ae          # The revision is used to prevent versioning conflicts
type: plopdown_v2                                   # The type is always "plopdown_v2"
title: Minnie the Moocher - Facts and Trivia        # The human readable title of the plopdown

xpath: /HTML[1]/BODY[1]/VIDEO[1]                    # (optional) Hint of the xpath where the video exists on the page
```

## Cues

Below the headers, and separated by a newline, are the cues which will be rendered into the video:

```json
info                                                // Required unique identifier for the cue
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000                       // Start and end timecodes
{                                                   // Begin Metadata
    "type": "INFO",                                 // Type of the cue being rendered.
    "title": "Minnie the Moocher",                  // Additional data as described by the type.
    "url": "https://plopdown.video",
    "authors": ["spaceribs"]
}                                                   // End Metadata
```

When you're ready, import your track into the plopdown plugin and go to the page with the video
to test out your new plopdown track. Check out the examples in the sidebar nav to explore the different
kinds of cues you can specify.
