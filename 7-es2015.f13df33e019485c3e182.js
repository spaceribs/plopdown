It's been a subtle shift, but with services like Netflix, Hulu and\nespecially YouTube, there are now many tools that take away the one superpower\nthat allowed the web to flourish, bi-directional interaction rather than\none-directional consumption. Here are a few examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>YouTube and YouTube content creators can shut down discussion in the comments section at any\nmoment, and even fair use critique of another video will likely gain\nyou a copyright strike via Content ID.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hulu attempts to prevent any and all modification of their website via the\nextensions you run. They recently removed the comments section and continue\nto move toward a one directional experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Netflix has never been built to be a bi-directional product, there is no\ncommunity space and even ratings are laundered in an algorithm. It's content\nlibrary shifts monthly without any say from the users.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What we need is a platform for critique, art, and entertainment which is\nonly connected to the original content by a timecode. Once we separate and\ndesign software that connects the two, we can once again have a mutual\nrelationship with the content we enjoy.</p>\n<p>Plopdown is the platform I'm building to do exactly that. It's is a way\nto inject specially crafted tracks into any HTML5 video as a web extension,\nannotate it, edit it down, add picture-in-picture, you name it. It doesn't\nhave all these capabilities yet, but that's the vision I want to achieve.</p>\n<p>If you share this vision, I'd love to work and collaborate with you!</p>\n<h2>Who am I</h2>\n<p>I'm a UI Developer based out of Baltimore, Maryland. I've been working\nin the web industry in various capacities since 2009.</p>\n<h2>What is Plopdown today</h2>\n<p>We have a fully working extension which scans for videos, saves those\nreferences, and allows you to associate them with a track. Whenever\nyou click on the extension button on a page, it will initialize\nthat track on top of the video.</p>\n<p>Tracks currently support the following cues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Info</strong>: Show a title screen for your track, with authors and a\nlink to your website.</li>\n<li><strong>Plop</strong>: Popup Video inspired annotations for trivia and fun facts.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio</strong>: Overlay and synchronize mp3 files with the playing video.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All features are fully manageable, configurable, and tested,\nbut definitely need tweaking and UX improvements.</p>\n<h2>Architectural Decisions</h2>\n<p>Throughout the proof of concept phase, I had to make some hard choices\nto build something I'd like to support for the next 10+ years. I'm sure\nI'll grow to hate at least some of these decisions down the road, but\nat this moment in time it makes sense:</p>\n<h3>I went with Angular</h3>\n<p>I'm a little biased, I use Angular with my team, but I actually started this\nproject in Vue. I switched away from Vue as soon as I hit my first refactor.\nI struggled to rebuild big parts of the application because Vue allowed me\nto do everything and nothing. I know I probably could have done this in React\nor continued with Vue, but because of the following reasons I decided against that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>I want to be able to pick up and put down this project quickly</strong> I have a life\nand a career, I want to be able to take 3 hours and throw a new feature in without\na lot of ramp up, I find Typescript + Angular allows me to do that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>I want to get better with RxJS</strong> I'm constantly learning new things with RxJS\nand it consistently challenges me. The fact that angular provides it out of the box\nfor a project that is literally dealing with a bunch of streaming events is the\nperfect way for me to practice as well as solve a technical problem effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>I eventually need amazing infrastructure</strong> Web Extensions are hard. managing\nmessages between multiple running applications is hard. Ensuring and maintaining\nproper error handling, code style, testing and readability, these are all extremely\nhard things. For all the boilerplate Angular requires, it does ensure an solid\nfoundation for exactly that.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are some serious issues with Angular for this particular project that I had\nto overcome:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Angular's Change Detector</strong> Zone.js doesn't know anything about the web extension\nAPI and the event's they emit. Any callbacks or promises need to be wrapped (and you\nneed to know how to wrap them manually). Although I've done that, this is still\nquite an annoying bug to track down for most developers that'll probably cause\nissues in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lack of Angular WebExt Ecosystem</strong> There isn't a lot of other people's web extension projects to\nfall back on for approach or informing design decisions, we're on our own in a lot\nof respects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Angular needs Rampup</strong> Just by going with Angular I'm probably alienating a lot\nof frontend developers, and for that I'm sorry. To develop on this extension, you are\ngoing to need to learn Typescript, RxJS and know the basics of Angular. I'm not\nexpecting perfection though, and I'll be happy to help.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>I went with an NX monorepo</h3>\n<p>Every component of a web-extension is designed as a separate application. The browser-action\npopup needs to talk to the background script, which needs to talk to the content scripts, etc.\nAll of these applications while running in separate execution environments, are indeed\ntightly coupled to work together to perform some pretty elaborate eventing.</p>\n<p>If I change the message for the popup app, I want to know that it breaks the background app,\nand I want to find these cross project issues as quickly as possible. I also want to\nshare libraries between these apps without copying stuff over, and make sure that I have\na scalable way of testing/building only the projects that need to be updated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nx.dev/angular\">NX</a> is a no-brainer for all this. We're never going to build\nanything outside of Javascript, as this will always be designed as a web extension,\nand it gives us a bunch of tools specifically for maintaining lots of different libraries\nand applications (including this very website).</p>\n<h3>I don't want analytics</h3>\n<p>You will find no privacy policy on this website or on the extension because I don't\ncollect any data. I promise you that I will never record your behavior, A/B test you,\nor generate statistics on what you watch.</p>\n<p>This is a tool for creating content, not surveillance.</p>\n<p>I'm depending on users to volunteer me feedback in our github issues:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/spaceribs/plopdown/issues\">https://github.com/spaceribs/plopdown/issues</a></p>\n<h3>I do want syndication</h3>\n<p>The ONLY data sync with the rest of the community that does ping back to any sort\nof centralized service will be the main syndication feed. I plan on keeping that\npopulated with awesome tracks from creators and notifying you with a badge on\nthe extension that a track is available for the content you're watching.</p>\n<p>The approach for this will be a once-a-day sync with the main content feed.\nQueries to determine which page your on and what content you're watching will\nall be done locally against your local copy of this feed. You will also be\nable to setup your own feed or turn this feature off entirely.</p>\n<h2>Special Thanks</h2>\n<p>I want to give a special shoutout to the following people for helping me get\nthis project across the finish line in no particular order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://orderoftheleague.com/\">The Order of the League</a></strong> - These guys have been\na huge help and support as my alpha testers for audio cues.
